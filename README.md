IsMinecraftDown
===============

A Bukkit Plugin designed to check the status of the Minecraft Services.

[BukkitDev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/isminecraftdown)

Planned Support
===============
This plugin is being planned to support multiple server platforms.

|Platform|Status|
|  --- | --- |
|Bukkit API| Supported |
|Sponge| Planned - API not ready |
|TridentSDK| Planned - API not ready |
|Stand Alone| W.I.P. - coming soon! |

Multiple platforms may use the same API(Ie: Bukkit API), this plugin should work on those platforms too.

How it works
============
Every few minutes(set in config), this plugin will "ping" mojang's services to get their status.

How to use the API
==================
Coming soon!
